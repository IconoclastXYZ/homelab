A great YAML based tool for creating a simple home page on the network with some basci built in service checks, all found [here](https://gethomepage.dev/)

All the icons you could possibly want for the links are [here](https://dashboardicons.com/) - just use the link name in lower case for icon: xxxx in the labels

Can integrate with the local Docker instance and uses tags to automatically creat entries

Can also ping and check http links
