## Proxmox with traefik and cloudflare, even using authentik
- Open ports 80 & 443 (as in the v1 and v2 guides above) - not ideal, can still check passwords, etc using tinyauth or authentik, etc.
- VPN - great for a single user, but not good if you want anything publically exposed
- Cloudflared tunnel - good guide [here](https://mattdyson.org/blog/2024/02/using-traefik-with-cloudflare-tunnels/) on how to put many of these pieces together! [This one](https://homelamb.github.io/posts/using-cloudflare-tunnel-with-traefik/) also gives some more details
- tailscale - good for access from pre-defined/connected endpoints - mentioned a few times above

## VPN with an exit node on the local network
[Using Cloudflare WARP, MASQUE and Dante SOCKS5 server](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiqc5xbNmks) with a [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/unRAID/comments/14qlay6/cloudflare_tunnel_as_a_exit_node/) on exit nodes on Cloudflare

- If you are using this method, you need to set the Windows Proxy to use the exit node, but that is not obvious, instead use [this](https://brightdata.com/blog/how-tos/set-up-proxy-in-windows-11#:~:text=in%20Windows%2011!-,Alternative%20Approach%3A%20Setting%20Up%20an%20HTTPS%20or%20SOCKS%20Proxy%20in%20Window%20Through%20the%20Control%20Panel,-The%20above%20procedure) method
